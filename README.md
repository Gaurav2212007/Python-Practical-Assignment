# Python Practical Assignment

This repository contains solutions to my Semester I Python workbook exercises.  
Topics covered include:
- Dictionaries
- Functions
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance, abstract classes)
- Operator overloading
- Data structures
- Practical problem-solving with Jupyter Notebook

Each assignment is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) and can be viewed directly on GitHub.
